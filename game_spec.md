**Game Title:** Karim Fist-bumper

**Game Type:** Clicker game

**Win Condition:**
Unlock all powerups and special characters to fist bump

**Lose Condition:**
N/A. You just wouldn't finish the game.

**Core Mechanics (3–5 features that MUST work):**
1. An ability to click Karim and get points
2. Able to purchase powerups & cosmetics
3. Graphics are visible and render when a user interacts

**Player Input (What does the user type?):**
The user clicks a central image in order to play the game. There will be various buttons in order to interact with the features of the game.

**Inputs We Will Validate (QA Test Ideas):**
We expect a left mouse click on all buttons. Other inputs, such as keyboard inputs and right clicks will be tested. 

**Known Limitations (Be honest):**
We likely won't be able to build in minigames, easter eggs, or high detailed graphics.

**Tech Stack:**
We will use the webdev suite with JavaScript, HTML, and possibly some CSS.

## Section 1 — Model Selection and Rationale

**Selected Model:** Waterfall  

### Rationale

The reason we chose the Waterfall model is that we had strict weekly deadlines and only a short amount of time to complete tasks. Each deadline aligned closely with a phase in the Waterfall SDLC.

* **Week 1:** Requirements, Design, Implementation  
* **Week 2:** Organized QA Testing  
* **Week 3:** Deployment and Maintenance  

We had only one week to produce an MVP, so organization was necessary to ensure a working product by the end of the week. Although the phases did not always feel distinct in the moment, they were still present and tied to deadlines.

While we did test features daily after adding them, this was informal testing by developers rather than structured QA. Structured QA occurred in Week 2.

Despite some feedback loops and iterative fixes, the overall structure still followed a phased, sequential approach consistent with Waterfall.
